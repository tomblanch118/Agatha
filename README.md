# Agatha
A Python based Basestation Software for Wireless Sensor Networks (and lots of other stuff too probably). Agatha takes packetised data from a serial device, filters out debug statements and sends everything to subscribers using ZeroMQ Pub/Sub. Subscribers subscribe to particular packet IDs and are sent packets, in byte form, as they are received. Responses can be sent back to Agatha for transmission over serial. This allows for a number of discrete programs to provide logging, responses to packets etc without everything becoming a horrible tangeld mess. Client programs can be stopped/restarted at will without interfering with other clients. Client programs can be written in any language that is supported by ZeroMQ. Round trip latency (recorded from the sending serial device) from the start of sending the serial data to getting a response was sub 1ms using a ~50byte packet at 115200 baud. Most of the time was spent transmitting over serial.
